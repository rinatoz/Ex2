#THE MAZE OF WAZE

## written on Eclipse

Second task in OOP course. Our project represent a 5 main classes: Node, Edge, DGraph, Graph_Algo, Graph_GUI.

This repository main purpose is to creates a directional graphs with nodes and edges, perform some algorithms on them and paints them on the screen with basic GUI.

nodeData - This class implements the interface node_data, and represent a node with a key.

EdgeData - This class represent an edge between two nodes with a specific direction.

DGraph - This class implements the graph interface, representing a basic graph that contains edges and verticles.

Graph_Algo - This class implemets graph_algorithms. Contains a set of algorithems and methods that can be performed on a given graph.

Graph_GUI - This class contains methods that can paint a graph to the screen, using StdDraw class and JFrame.
